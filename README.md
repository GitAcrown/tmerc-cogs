# tmerc-cogs

Cogs for Twentysix26's [Red Discord bot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot).

Please note that this repository is not approved (yet?), and is mostly for my own personal use. Feel free to add it to your bot, if you'd like, as I do my best to avoid breaking changes. However, I provide no guarantee.

If you do use these, and run into trouble, you can [https://github.com/tmercswims/tmerc-cogs/issues/new](open an issue) and I will do my best to help you out.
